# Spotify Skip Prediction

This was the Capstone project for my Masters degree at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). This project looked at data provided by Spotify in an effort to help determine which of 10 future tracks a listener would skip based on their listening history with 10 historical tracks in a session.
